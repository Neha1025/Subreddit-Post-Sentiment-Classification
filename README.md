# Subreddit-Post-Sentiment-Classification
Reddit is made of threads which contain posts generated by the users.The task is to predict the sentiment polarity of each post individually. The dataset contains our target column called “sentiment.polarity” which can take 5 values: "very negative", "negative", "neutral", "positive" and "very positive" (multi-label classification/prediction).
